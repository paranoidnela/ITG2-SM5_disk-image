# TODO
- Enable more protocols to add songs
- Ship ready to use disk images
- Create internal build enviroment for binary releases
- Add UEFI instructions
- Find solution to minimise RW data when machine is running to prevent data corruption in arcade enviroments.
- Overcome more DEBIAN_INSTALL.md dependent steps in later stages of installation to better prevent user errors.
- Create Ansible deployment files
- Ship integrated support for lights and common input solutions
- Install arandr and create a similar solution to `filemanager.sh` for easier video.sh management
- Fix the library symlink in a cleaner way (debian won't do this by default, stepmania binaries still want the old library name and stepmania devs don't ship appimages, I can't think of clean ways to do this)
- Fix grammar
